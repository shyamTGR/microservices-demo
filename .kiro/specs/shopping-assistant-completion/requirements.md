# Requirements Document

## Introduction

Complete the deployment of the Shopping Assistant service for the Online Boutique microservices application. The infrastructure (AlloyDB cluster, service accounts, Kubernetes manifests) is already deployed, but the service needs database population with product embeddings and container image building to become fully functional. The Shopping Assistant provides AI-powered product recommendations using Gemini and vector search capabilities.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the AlloyDB databases to be properly initialized with the required schema and data, so that the Shopping Assistant service can store and query product embeddings.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the database setup is executed THEN the system SHALL create a "products" database in AlloyDB
2. WHEN the database setup is executed THEN the system SHALL create a "carts" database in AlloyDB  
3. WHEN the products database is created THEN the system SHALL create the required table schema for storing product embeddings
4. WHEN the product data is processed THEN the system SHALL populate the products table with vector embeddings for all products from products.json
5. IF the database connection fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and retry mechanisms

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the Shopping Assistant service container image to be built and deployed, so that the service can run in the Kubernetes cluster.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the container build process is initiated THEN the system SHALL build the Shopping Assistant service image using the existing Dockerfile
2. WHEN the image is built THEN the system SHALL push it to the Google Artifact Registry
3. WHEN the image is available THEN the Kubernetes deployment SHALL pull and run the container successfully
4. WHEN the service starts THEN it SHALL connect to AlloyDB using the configured credentials
5. IF the image build fails THEN the system SHALL provide detailed error logs for troubleshooting

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the Shopping Assistant service to be accessible through the frontend application, so that I can get AI-powered product recommendations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Shopping Assistant service is deployed THEN it SHALL be accessible at the configured service endpoint
2. WHEN a user sends a request with an image and prompt THEN the service SHALL return relevant product recommendations
3. WHEN the service processes requests THEN it SHALL use vector similarity search against the populated product database
4. WHEN the service generates responses THEN it SHALL include product IDs in the specified format for frontend integration
5. IF the service is unavailable THEN the frontend SHALL handle the error gracefully without breaking the main shopping experience

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to ensure the deployment stays within GCP project quotas, so that the system doesn't run into errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing the solution THEN the system SHALL use existing infrastructure and minimize new resource creation
2. WHEN building container images THEN the system SHALL use efficient build processes to minimize compute usage
3. WHEN populating the database THEN the system SHALL use batch processing to avoid API rate limits
4. WHEN the service is running THEN it SHALL use the existing AlloyDB instance without requiring additional database resources
5. IF quota limits are approached THEN the system SHALL provide warnings and suggest optimization strategies

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to verify that the Shopping Assistant deployment is working correctly, so that I can confirm the feature is ready for users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the deployment is complete THEN the system SHALL provide verification steps to test the service functionality
2. WHEN verification tests are run THEN they SHALL confirm database connectivity and data population
3. WHEN verification tests are run THEN they SHALL confirm the service responds to API requests correctly
4. WHEN verification tests are run THEN they SHALL confirm integration with the frontend application
5. IF any verification step fails THEN the system SHALL provide specific troubleshooting guidance
